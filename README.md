C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

In this projects, I carried out the following tasks;

Task 0: 
Wrote a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order
using the Bubble sort algorithm. The array is printed each time two elements are
printed.

Task 1: 
Wrote a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in
ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm by swapping the nodes
themselves without modifying the integers of any node. The list is printed each
time two elements are swapped.

Task 2: 
Wrote a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order
using the Selection sort algorithm. The array is printed each time two elements
are swapped.

Task 3: 
Wrote a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending
order using the Quick sort algorithm, using the Lomuto partition scheme. The
array is printed each time two elements are swapped.
